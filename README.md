# misc-projects
Source code for various small C++/MATLAB Projects

## Significant C++ Projects

[WebCrawler](/C++/WebCrawler): A C++ program which will retreive the www.msn.com/ webpage, and display the hyperlinks found on that page as well as display the hyperlinks found within each of those hyperlinks.

[FileParser](/C++/FileParser): A C++ program that will input a set of simple ASCII text files and store information about each file's contents. The user will be allowed to search throughout any of the files for a target word, and the program will display what files the word can be found in as well as the line numbers it is found on.

[citydatabase.cpp](/C++/citydatabase.cpp): A simple C++ local database that stores information about cities using a BST. The user will be allowed to search by either name or coordinates as per the contents of the database.

[RPNC.cpp](/C++/RPNC.cpp): A simple RPNC calculator using a stack.

## Significant MATLAB Projects

[windspeed.m](/MATLAB/windspeed.m): A MATLAB program which will download and extract weather data from certain weather stations, and plot the changes in windspeed over time as observed by those stations.

#### Plot Example

[oscilloscope-sim.m](/MATLAB/oscilloscope-sim.m): A simple MATLAB program meant to simulate oscilloscope waveforms at certain frequencies and duty cycles. Will display plots consisting of square and triangle waves.
