# misc-projects
Source code for various small C++/MATLAB Projects

## Significant C++ Projects

[WebCrawler](/C++/WebCrawler): A C++ program which will retreive the www.msn.com/ webpage, and display the hyperlinks found on that page as well as display the hyperlinks found within each of those hyperlinks.

## Significant MATLAB Projects

[windspeed.m](/MATLAB/windspeed.m): A MATLAB program which will download and extract weather data from certain weather stations, and plot the changes in windspeed over time as observed by those stations.

#### Plot Example
![Example Figure1](/MATLAB/windspeed_plot.png)

[oscilloscope-sim.m](/MATLAB/oscilloscope-sim.m): A simple MATLAB program meant to simulate oscilloscope waveforms at certain frequencies and duty cycles. Will display 9 plots comprising of square and triangle waves.
